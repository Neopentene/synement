### A replacement for my college's assignment-tracking system
This frontend is written in React.js and heavily relies on the [Synement API](https://synement.herokuapp.com/docs) which was written by Danyl which is a scraper written in Python.

üé® Design
=========
- This website was designed by Danyl from scratch.
- Every element, color & design choice was his.

üåü Motivation
=============
- My college recently (a/o July 2021) bought a new ERP system and we switched from Google Classroom (where assignments were easy to track & there were notifications) to this new ERP.
- All our assignments are added here but there was a problem - the UI is horrendous and unresponsive & there's no sort of notification system.
- This is what it looks like (at the time of this writing):

- So I set out to change that and this project is the result of just that üòâ
